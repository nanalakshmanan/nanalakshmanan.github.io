...for the amazing memories.

Back in November 2005, I relocated from India to work at Microsoft on a project code named
[**Monad**](http://www.jsnover.com/Docs/MonadManifesto.pdf).It was a wonderful journey of 11 memorable years. Journey that
was filled with oppurtunities. I could participate in efforts that were forefront in the company as well as in the
industry. When people me stories about how my work transformed their lives it was such a delight. One of the other
aspects that I loved about my time at Microsoft was the brilliant minds that I got to work with. Many are well regarded
in the industry and it was an experience collaborating with them. I also learnt a lot - how to appreciate little things, 
how to value diverse perspectives, how to bounce back from failures, what does it take to be a true professional, how
to build software, how to build a community... the list is rather long. Most importantly Microsoft also taught me the
important of giving. During my time at Microsoft, there has always been something exciting to look forward to and now 
when I look back this has been an amazing journey.
However, I am in an industry where we love change. Here is my favorite quote on change from the father and inventor of
[**PowerShell**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell) - [**Jeffrey Snover**](https://twitter.com/jsnover)

**So in the IT profession, we learn new things. If you didn’t want to learn new things, you should get into lumber. 
There has not been a new tree in quite a long time.**

So I have decided to pursue change - an oppurtunity outside of Microsoft. This does not mean that change isn’t possible
at Microsoft. Microsoft as a company has been constantly changing and I am proud of having been through the journey. 
However, cross pollination is good for the industry. That is how I feel we all learn. In fact that is how we also unlearn.
Look at some of the big names at Microsoft. Many of them landed there with lots of prior experience elsewhere in the industry. Also look at other big
companies. There are many in leadership positions who started their careers at Microsoft. Varied experience and
movement across companies seems to be doing good to the industry. It keeps the HR and Recruting departments busy with
retention and hiring headaches as well.

If you have friends or family from other companies looking for a change or just graduating and looking for an opportunity,
I highly recommend Microsoft as a great place to work. The innovation and culture is something that I have always been 
proud of. Please do stay in touch. Whether it is talking technology, discussing charity or just having a cup of coffee I 
will be delighted to connect. You can follow me on Twitter [@nanalakshmanan](https://twitter.com/NanaLakshmanan)
