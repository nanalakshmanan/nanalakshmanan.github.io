The first customary post from a developer...

The world around us is changing. It is changing faster than ever in history. Being part of technology industry, that also means I keep learning new things to 
keep pace with this ever changing world. That brought me to github and the wonderful world around it. So when I learnt about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)  I made a note that
I should build a website using the same. The need to blog something forced that day to arrive today. Here is my first 'Hello World' post hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and
[Jekyll](http://www.jekyllbootstrap.com/) (*to generate the content*). The theme used for this website is [SO Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/). For authoring this post and others I used [MarkPad](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/markpad/9wzdncrdcfsb) from the Windows 10 App store
